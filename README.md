Daily Bookmark Check helps you clean up your bookmarks step by step. It presents you 3 random bookmarks each day to either mark as "keep" or "remove".

## Getting Started

Clone the repository

```sh
> git clone git@github.com:zlypher/daily-bookmark-check.git
```

Install dependencies

```sh
> cd daily-bookmark-check
> npm install
```

Start development

```sh
> npm run dev
```

This will run `parcel` as well as `web-ext`. A new Firefox instance will open with the extension temporarily installed. Any file changes will automatically be applied.
